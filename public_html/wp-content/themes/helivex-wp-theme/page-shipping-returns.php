                <p class="text-xs text-zinc-600 leading-relaxed">
                    Helivex Labs ships exclusively within the <strong>United States</strong>. We do not offer international shipping to maintain strict regulatory compliance with export laws. 
                    All orders are processed within 24-48 business hours and shipped via tracked carrier.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold uppercase tracking-tight">1. Delivery Times</h3>
            <p>
                Standard laboratory fulfillment typically arrives within 3-5 business days. You will receive a tracking number via email once your research compounds have been dispatched.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold uppercase tracking-tight">2. Shipping Integrity</h3>
            <p>
                All research compounds are shipped in protective, discrete packaging. We utilize climate-monitored shipping routes where possible to ensure that lyophilized materials remain stable during transit.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold uppercase tracking-tight">3. Lost or Misdelivered Packages</h3>
            <p>
                Once a package is marked as delivered by the carrier, Helivex Labs is not responsible for theft or misplacement. If your tracking indicates "Delivered" but you have not received your package, please contact the carrier directly to open a research case.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold uppercase tracking-tight">4. Chargebacks & Disputes</h3>
            <p>
                We encourage all researchers to contact <strong>support@helivexlabs.com</strong> before initiating a bank dispute. Fraudulent chargebacks are taken seriously and will result in a permanent ban from our supply network and reporting to high-risk merchant databases.
